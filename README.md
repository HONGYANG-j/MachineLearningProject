# Predicting Child Health Vulnerabilities in Malaysia

This repository contains a Streamlit-based Machine Learning application developed in conjunction with the BSD3523 – Machine Learning (Group Project).

The system supports scenario-based analysis of child health vulnerability in Malaysia by predicting child mortality rates using socio-economic, infrastructure, and demographic indicators.

The application presents predictive results through an interactive web interface which provides insights to support policymakers in identifying high-risk areas and improving targeted child health interventions.
